# San Francisco Airport Dashboard:

The main goal of this project was to learn data visualization techniques using a dataset related to San Francisco International Airport (SF airport).


## Description
To start, I cleaned up the dataset using Tableau's 'Data Interpreter' feature. Then, I used different types of charts and graphs to analyze the data step by step.

I began by using a scatter plot to figure out the busiest day at the airport. Next, I created a line chart to see how the number of flights varied each month. For identifying the top 10 longest flight routes, I used a simple bar chart. To visualize flight routes leaving SF airport, I utilized latitude and longitude data, plotting them as rows and columns. This allowed me to use the map option to display the flight routes effectively.

Finally, I combined all these individual analyses into a single dashboard. This makes it easy for anyone looking at the project to see the key insights in one place.
